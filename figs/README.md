# Some favourite figures collected from the tcases folder 

There are a lot of test cases selected from the well-known pubplication of Prof. R. Gorentflo. Herein I've uploaded some of them, which are plotted by Gnuplot. 

Figures are plotted with |z| and |E| on the horizontal and vertical axises, respectively, where "_mlf" stands for Mittag-Leffler function (E), and "_mld" stands for its derivative (dE/dz). For instance, the file  "Gorenflo_c05_fig09_mlf.pdf" is similar to Fig. 09 of Gorentflo's paper, i.e. |E| versus |z|, which is plotted from the test case c05, i.e. tt_mlfm_c05.txt. 

I will continue updating figures when I have a time. Or, you can do it by yourself. To plot the test cases, read **README.md** inside the **tcases** folder to gain description of the files.
