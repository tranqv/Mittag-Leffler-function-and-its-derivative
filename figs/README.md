# Some favourite figures collected from the tcases folder 

There are a lot of test cases selected from the well-known pubplication of Prof. R. Gorentflo. Herein I've uploaded some of them, which are plotted by Gnuplot. 

I will continue updating Figs. when I have a time. Or, you can do it by yourself. To plot the test cases, read README.txt inside the tcases folder to gain description of the files.
